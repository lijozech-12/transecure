Description:

    Transecure is decentralized intracompany transaction management system to ensure that all transactions are transparent and all
    finances are accounted for which is realized by using Blockchain Technology

    What we Do:

    1.    Creating a portal for all company transactions to be done.
    2.    All transactions are confirmed at specific times throughout the day.
    3.    Each transaction is verified before being commited.
    4.    All transactions stay in the blockchain at all times.
    5.    All transactions can be traced back hence reduces fraudulency.
    6.    If there's a fraudulent transaction it immediately gets flagged as an impossible transaction.

Ways to host the project on the localhost:
    
    #To start app server with 2 nodes in the blockchain#

    Open the terminal and Navigate to the 'BlockchainCode' directory then run below command

    " python transecure/app.py & python BlockchainApp/app.py -p 8000 & python BlockchainApp/app.py -p 8001 "

    Then navigate to 'TransecureAPP' directory then run below command

    " python app.py " #it will start running on port no 5000
